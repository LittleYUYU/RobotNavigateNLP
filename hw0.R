print(paste("Usually, robots can follow a set of machine instructions. For example, '(3,5,180) (3,7,270), ...' means that the robot walks from position(3,5) with orientation 180 degree to position(3,7), then it turns its orientation to 270 degree for the next instruction. However, this is unfriendly to human instructor since no one would talk with numbers. Therefore, in this project, we want to design a model to translate natural language (e.g., 'place your back against the wall of the “T” intersection') to machine interpretable instructions (corresponding to '(3,5,0),(3,5,180)'). "))
